I wanted to work with things I never have before. This was a mistake. 

first I decided to work with steganography, this was fun. I ended up using the first two pixles to map the key. g1+g2 and b1+b2 mapped
the two pixles I would use to encode data. they return a hex then I got them to a binary string to encode the data. 
If I had more time I would have liked to store the data back into the bitmap but I did not have time so it ended up in a .txt. 

This is also my first time creating a project like this in c, I had a lot of difficulty getting to the point of understanding strings
and how to use them. I should have done this in c++.

the code its self is a dumpster fire.
