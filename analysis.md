I have made yet anoter mistake, the .exe only works on 64 bit machines. I'll do my best on my host computer. 

the biggest tip off is that the .exe creates a .bmp and two .txt files. one of the .txt files contains what seems like imput data, the 
other contains binary repersentations that do not match up with the first file. with this I can assume the second file is encoded somehow. 
I can assume since there is a .bmp the key must be created from that, since both the encoded and plain data are in .txt files I can assume 
they are not stored in the .bmp or if they are I'm not worried about it.

I cant get a dissassembler to work on my host computer.

because I made it and I know how to find the key it would be easy to see the varaiables used to create the key. then  I could just make my
own program to generate the key using the created .bmp
