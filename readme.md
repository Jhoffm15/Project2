There are no special requirements to use this program. just download and run. 


sadly there is no way to edit the files via the program, I just did not have enough time to get to that. However you can edit the .txt
files this program creates, I put in a useless user imput to give the user the opertunity to do this before the check happens. if the 
inputs match it will return nothing but if they do not match it will return "false" right now only healthpoints is checked. 
hitpoints is the first entry in both .txt files. default hitpoints is set to the int 111.
