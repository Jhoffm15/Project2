Strengths:
difficult to find out where the key is
requires knoledge of steganography.
key is not plainly stored until runtime. 
a lot of key combanation potential. 

weaknesses:
once you figure out where the key is you have full acess to change any data you want. 
shoddy coding at best, easy to track. 
key is stored during runtime. 
once you know how to index the key its easy to find. 

future changes:
not storing key during runtime, it can be passed around without being stored. just retrive it each time. 
changing keys and encoded data during runtime randomly. 
clean up code
store encrypyed data in the .bmp file not in a .txt
